    "PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION TIPS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PARTITIONING\n",
    "   - Partition tables by frequently filtered columns (date, region, etc.)\n",
    "   - Query: WHERE date >= '2024-01-01' will skip irrelevant partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. AVOID SELECT *\n",
    "   - Only select columns you need\n",
    "   - Reduces data transfer and memory usage\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. FILTER EARLY\n",
    "   - Apply WHERE clauses before joins when possible\n",
    "   - Reduces data volume in subsequent operations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. USE APPROPRIATE JOINS\n",
    "   - Broadcast join for small tables (<10GB in Spark)\n",
    "   - Sort-merge join for large tables\n",
    "\n",
    "5. LIMIT SUBQUERIES\n",
    "   - Use CTEs for better readability and optimization\n",
    "   - Avoid correlated subqueries when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "6. AGGREGATION OPTIMIZATION\n",
    "   - Push down aggregations where possible\n",
    "   - Use approximate functions for large datasets (approx_count_distinct)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. CACHE FREQUENTLY USED DATA\n",
    "   - In Databricks: CACHE TABLE table_name\n",
    "   - Useful for iterative queries\n",
    "\n",
    "8. EXPLAIN PLAN\n",
    "   - Use EXPLAIN to understand query execution\n",
    "   - Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities\n",
