    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which of the following best describes the Databricks Lakehouse platform?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A) A data warehouse built on cloud storage  \n",
    "B) A data lake with ACID transactions and data management features  \n",

    "**Answer: B**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The Databricks Lakehouse combines the best of data lakes and data warehouses. It provides:\n",
    "- Cost-effective storage of data lakes (on cloud object storage)\n",
    "- ACID transactions and data management features of data warehouses\n",
    "- Support for both structured and unstructured data\n",
    "- Unified platform for BI, ML, and streaming\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Unity Catalog uses a three-level namespace:\n",
    "1. **Catalog** - Top level, represents a collection of schemas\n",
    "2. **Schema** (or Database) - Contains tables, views, and functions\n",
    "3. **Table** (or View) - The actual data objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `my_catalog.sales_schema.customer_table`\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure provides better organization and governance compared to traditional two-level namespaces.\n",
